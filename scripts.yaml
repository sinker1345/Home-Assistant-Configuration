                 "I am sorry to interrupt your long romance with the pillow, but a beautiful morning awaits you, i am sorry you have to take off those sheets that make you happy but a nice dawn is happening, I am sorry that was all a lie, hurry up it is raining and there is traffic. Good Morning!",
                 "Good morning! come on, get up, the day does not mess up by itself.",
